# Vulnerability Scan - Process Overview

## Objective

Understand the process of identifying vulnerabilities on a computer using free tools.

## Steps (Based on Research)

1.  **Installation (Simulated)**:
    *   Read about the installation process for OpenVAS and Nessus.
    *   Understand the dependencies and system requirements.
    *   Note potential installation issues and troubleshooting steps.
2.  **Scan Target Setup (Simulated)**:
    *   Learn how to configure the scan target (local IP or localhost).
    *   Understand the importance of setting appropriate scan parameters.
3.  **Full Scan Initiation (Simulated)**:
    *   Research how to start a full vulnerability scan.
    *   Understand the different scan profiles and their purposes.
4.  **Scan Completion and Monitoring (Simulated)**:
    *   Learn about the time it takes for a scan to complete (30-60 mins).
    *   Understand how to monitor the scan progress and identify potential issues.
5.  **Report Review (Simulated)**:
    *   Study example vulnerability reports.
    *   Understand how to interpret the severity levels and types of vulnerabilities.
6.  **Fix Research (Simulated)**:
    *   Research how to find fixes or mitigations for common vulnerabilities.
    *   Understand the importance of patching and updating systems.
